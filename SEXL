Title: Sex-Linked Inheritance
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/sexl/

Given: An array A of length n for which A[k] represents the
proportion of males in a population exhibiting the k-th of
n total recessive X-linked genes. Assume that the population
is in genetic equilibrium for all n genes.

Return: An array B of length n in which B[k] equals the
probability that a randomly selected female will be a
carrier for the k-th gene.
